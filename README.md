# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing for Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning applications. The notebook follows a structured approach to handle common data quality issues, including missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling. The goal is to transform the raw Titanic passenger data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis and predictive modeling.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial examination of the dataset structure, statistical properties, and visualization of distributions to identify key issues like missing values and outliers.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: Systematic approach to detect and address null values in both numerical and categorical columns through imputation or removal.

3. **Encoding Categorical Features**: Conversion of categorical variables into numerical formats using appropriate encoding techniques to make the data machine-readable.

4. **Feature Scaling and Outlier Treatment**: Normalization of numerical features and visualization of results to ensure all features are on a similar scale and outliers are properly addressed.

The notebook demonstrates essential data preprocessing techniques using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, providing a comprehensive example of preparing real-world data for machine learning tasks.
